\preface

The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \emph{Galois theory} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into thirteen two-hour lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on fields and Galois theory 
are for example \cite{MR1645586} and 
\cite{MR3379917}. 

As usual, we also mention a set of 
\href{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}{great expository papers} by 
Keith Conrad, the notes are extremely well-written and useful  
at every stage of a mathematical career. 

Several chapters contain optional paragraphs which give examples of 
how to apply \href{https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/}{OSCAR Computer Algebra System}
to concrete problems in Galois theory. 

 
Thanks go to Wouter Appelmans, Alejandro de la Cueva Merino, Wannes Malfait.
