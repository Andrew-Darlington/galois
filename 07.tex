\begin{theorem}[Artin]
\index{Artin's theorem}
\label{thm:ArtinGalois}
    Let $E$ be a field and $G$ be a finite group of automorphisms of $E$. 
    If $K=\prescript{G}{}{E}$, then $E/K$ is a Galois extension,
    $[E:K]=|G|$ and $\Gal(E/K)=G$. 
\end{theorem}

Before proving the theorem, we need a lemma.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E/K$ be a separable extension such that $\deg(x,K)\leq m$
    for all $x\in E$. Then $E/K$ is finite and $[E:K]\leq m$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
   Let $z\in E$ be of maximal degree. If $x\in E$, 
   then $K(x,z)/K$ is separable. Then $K(x,z)=K(y)$ for some $y$. 
   It follows that 
   \[
   K(z)\subseteq K(x,z)=K(y).
   \]
   Since 
   $\deg(z,K)\leq\deg(y,K)$, it follows that
   $\deg(z,K)=\deg(y,K)$ and hence 
   $K(y)=K(z)$. In particular, $x\in K(z)$ and
   therefore $E=K(z)$. 
\end{proof}

Now we are ready to prove Artin's theorem: 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:ArtinGalois}]
    Note that $G\subseteq\Gal(E/K)$. Let $x\in E$ and 
    \[
    f_x=\prod_{y\in O_G(x)}(X-y).
    \]
    Since $f_x\in K[X]$, it follows
    that $E/K$ is normal and separable, so $E/K$ is a Galois extension. Moreover, 
    \[
    \deg(x,K)\leq \deg f_x=|O_G(x)|\leq |G|.
    \]
    By the previous lemma, $E/K$ is finite and $[E:K]\leq |G|$. This
    implies that
    $|G(E/K)|=[E:K]\leq |G|$ and hence $|G(E/K)|=|G|$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Let $E=K(X,Y)$ and $\sigma\colon K[X,Y]\to E$ be the ring homomorphism given by $\sigma(X)=Y$ and $\sigma(Y)=X$. Note that $\sigma$ is bijective, as $\sigma^2=\id$. The map $\sigma$ induces
    a field homomorphism $\overline{\sigma}\colon E\to E$ such that 
    $\overline{\sigma}^2=\id$. Recall that such a homomorphism is given by 
    $f/g\mapsto \sigma(f)/\sigma(g)$. Let $G=\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle$. Then $|G|=2$. 
    We claim that $\prescript{G}{}{E}=K(X+Y,XY)$. Let $F==K(X+Y,XY)$. We only prove
    that $\prescript{G}{}{E}\subseteq F$, as the other inclusion is trivial. Artin's theorem
    implies that $[E:\prescript{G}{}{E}]=2$ and $E=F(X)$, as $X$ is a root
    of the polynomial $Z^2-(X+Y)Z+XY$. Then $[E:F]\leq 2$ and $[\prescript{G}{}{E}:F]=1$.
\end{example}

\topic{Galois' correspondence}

\begin{theorem}[Galois]
\index{Galois' theorem}
    Let $E/K$ be a finite Galois extension and $G=\Gal(E/K)$. 
    There exists a bijective correspondence
    \[
    \{F:K\subseteq F\subseteq E\text{ subfields}\}\to 
    \{\text{subgroups of $G$}\}
    \]
    The correspondence is given by $F\mapsto G(E/F)$ and 
    $\prescript{S}{}{E}\mapsfrom S$. Moreover, 
    normal subextensions of $E/K$ correspond 
    to normal subgroups of $G$. 
\end{theorem}
